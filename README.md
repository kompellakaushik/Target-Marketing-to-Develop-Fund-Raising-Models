# Target-Marketing-to-Develop-Fund-Raising-Models
Developed a classification model for a national veteran’s organization to improve the cost effectiveness of their direct marketing campaign and capture potential donors.
Cleaned the data set containing around 500 attributes and 10,000 data points.
Reduced the dimensions in the data using PCA and selected final set of variables using Random Forests variable importance techniques. Applied machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and SVM’s to build the model.
